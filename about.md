### About me

I like programming. I also like to read. This can sometimes be a bad combination, and I've had trouble getting out of analysis-paralysis in the past. I'm working on it.

Beyond that, my interests are typical, I guess? I enjoy long walks, reading, good sci-fi. I used to be an editor for a very small independent online publication of a modern literature sort. I used to enjoy motorcycling, but have little time and not enough motorcycle left for it these days. I think there's more here, but I can't quite remember at the moment, so this will have to do.
