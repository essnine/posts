# Hello, world!

This is Suraj. I'm a programmer, and I've been working professionally as a backend developer since 2018. I primarily work in Python, but I'm comfortable reading and writing code in other languages whenever needed. I'm currently working at [Cognida.ai](https://cognida.ai).

I occasionally write stuff, but seldom publish it. I'm trying to break out of that pattern, and might post more often [here](./pages).
My GitHub profile is linked [here](https://github.com/essnine), but I'm not very active on there.
I'm not very active on social media, despite having an account on most of them. Make of that what you will.

Cheers!
